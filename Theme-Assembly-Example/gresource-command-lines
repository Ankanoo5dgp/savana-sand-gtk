My theme resides in the .themes folder, so first I made a gtk.gresource.xml, this includes all the individual files of what is in your GTK-3.0 folder. 

open terminal in GTK-3.0 of the theme: this is my terminal command:

glib-compile-resources gtk.gresource.xml

this here is the long version, but the sort version above works too:

glib-compile-resources --sourcedir=/home/paul/.themes/Prof-Gnome-light-4.0/gtk-3.0 --target=/home/paul/.themes/Prof-Gnome-light-4.0/gtk-3.0/gtk.gresource /home/paul/.themes/Prof-Gnome-light-4.0/gtk-3.0/gtk.gresource.xml

If it finishes correctly (you must be certain of the correct files !), you will get a  
gtk.resource in your GTK-3.0-folder:

then change gtk.css with only this line:
@import url("resource:///org/gnome/theme/gtk.css");

and change gtk-dark.css with only this line:
@import url("resource:///org/gnome/theme/gtk-dark.css");

GTK-3.0 file should only include:
gtk.css
gtk-dark.css
gtk.gresource
